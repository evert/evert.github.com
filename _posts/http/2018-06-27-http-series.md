Because I want to get into the habit of blogging on a regular basis, I thought
it would be a fun idea to write a series of articles on one of my favourite
topics: HTTP and Webservices.

To start, I began writing an article for every HTTP status code. I only
realized after I drafted the first few, that the [IANA][1] page actually lists
68 official ones. Definitely a bit more than I thought, but I started and I'm
going to see if I can finish it.

My long term dream is to write a book on the matter, and I figured this might
be a nice way to try and see if I'm cut out for it. Perhaps I can use these
articles as sample chapters.

I would love to hear what you think; good or bad. If you like the idea of
(yet) another book about this, it really helps to know how many people would
want to read it.

I'm going to release the first few this week, and then switch to a weekly
schedule. Hopefully I can keep this going for a year!

Today I published the first one: [100 Continue][2].
