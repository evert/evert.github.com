[`303 See Other`][1] can be used to tell a client that the result of the
operation can be found on another location.

For example, if a client did a `POST` request, a server _might_ immediately
respond to that `POST` request with a response body, for example to inform the
client or user that the operation was successful.

It's sometimes better to not do that, and immediately redirect the user to a
new page instead. One reason is that in browsers, it messes with the "back"
button and will ask the user to submit the a form again. When redirecting
immediately, browsers don't do this and this is extremely common practice.

So `303` means that the server is not immediately returning a result, but it
instructs the client to go look somewhere else to get the result. The client
_must_ use a `GET` request for this.

Most webservices and server frameworks incorrectly use the [`302 Found`][2]
status-code for this instead.

Example
-------

```http
HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
Server: Curveball/0.4.0
Location: /confirmation
```
