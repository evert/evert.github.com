Assuming you're correct, then the inability to use prepared queries means that the solution is to use a real database, because you're already doomed. If you're wrong, then you don't know enough to write your query creating code anyway.\r\n\r\nEither way, you need to use a quality database (PostgreSQL is also open source and is well respected, and SQL Server Express is free and more than good enough for most people's needs) and not screw around building queries in ASCII strings.\r\n\r\n\r\nStill, the other possibility is that I'm entirely retarded, and that leads us back to where we started: taking security advice from anonomous tards on the net (such as me) is usually a bad idea.  ;)\r\n\r\nBut I've never seen a professional security expert advocate any form of SQL injection prevention that doesn't include the use of prepared queries.",

Your posts have been extremely insightful, but I have a few questions (which may/may not be stupid)\r\n\r\nMy current situation is that I'm storing lat/lng as regular float columns in mysql. I'm searching this data based on a center point and a radius.\r\n\r\n1. My query uses the spherical law of cosines to calculate distance from the center point\r\n2. In my application code I calculate a bounding box based on the earth's radius/center point/search radius\r\n3. Not surprisingly, the query rarely uses my lat/lng indexes\r\n\r\nThe bounding box is essentially useless in my current code, but after reading about your experiments with the Morton number I wonder if it would be useful if I converted those coordinates to Morton numbers and used that instead of the bounding box (or in addition to)?\r\n\r\nMy understanding of this and the math behind it is quite slim, and just enough to get my application working so bear with me ;)\r\n\r\nAlso, PHP is a bit of a pain when it comes to dealing with unsigned integers, any tips for calculating the Morton number in this case?\r\n\r\nThank you!",

Taking your points in order:</p><p>- The default charset was never respected. Python's requests library followed it and we got so many bug reports for that behaviour. New RFCs correctly say that HTML does not meaningfully have a default encoding (in practice it's usually UTF-8).<br>- PUT means 'here is the entire entity', store this at the chosen request URI. That is semantically incompatible with 'I am sending you these bytes of the entity'. PATCH should be used here. All this change does is spell out the inconsistency.<br>- I honestly have no clue about what this point is talking about, seemed unclear to me.<br>- Caches were already caching these response codes: for example, Squid and Traffic Server, some of the widest-deployed caches already did this. In fact, the spec treaded a middle ground in the hope that these caches would stop caching some other dangerous responses (like 500).<br>- Relative URIs in Location headers were already being used A LOT. All modern user-agents can handle them.<br>- I'll turn straight to RFC 7231 for this: \"The Content-MD5 header field has been removed because it was inconsistently implemented with respect to partial responses.\"</p><p>The global implications here are very minor. No-one was following RFC 2616 to the letter: you cannot operate on the modern web if you do that. This specification change brought HTTP/1.1 up to date with how it's actually used on the web, while attempting to rein in some of the biggest excesses.</p><p>HTTP/1.1, before today, was not the protocol written in RFC 2616. It's much more like the protocol written in RFC 723[0-5]. Better to have some RFCs that actually reflect how the protocol truly is than some idealised notion of a protocol that does not exist.

That\u2019s serious fault from their part, I consider. I would consider it a sufficient reason to move my data (contacts and calendar) from Google to another provider: I don\u2019t want to be locked with, or to support, a non standard-compliant provider.</p><p>However, such strong claims as those you are making should be supported with easily verifiable facts. After all, you could be sincere but mistaken for some subtle reason. Furthermore, there is a clear conflict of interest here in Fruux people saying that Google\u2019s calendar product is somehow flawed.</p><p>To be honest, I consider it your responsibility to make your claims as easily verifiable as possible by your readers. A good and easy way would be to report a bug, very precisely described and reproducible, in some public place where Google will have a chance to answer if they diagree with your claims. Google forums [<a href=\"https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/calendar\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/calendar\">https://productforums.googl...</a>] come to mind. I know it would take yet a bit more of your time, but considering the time you have already spent on the matter, and considering the seriousness of the matter, it seems like an appropriate investment. Also, it should not take long as you probably simply have to copy/paste the descriptions you tried to send to Google\u2019s developers.</p><p>I know that I can verify your claims myself by reading the specs, implementing a program, and testing to send cards to Google servers as you did. This would take enormous time, and would only enlighten one person (me). And it is certain that most of your readers will not do this. Whereas you posting a bug report, assuming Google is unable to provide a satisfactory answer, would make it clear for everybody that the fault is theirs. You (at Fruux) would also gain from this.</p><p>Contrapositively, you not doing it raises a bit of suspicion against your claims. I am trying to be honest and constructive here, I hope you will not take it personally.</p>",

            "message": "<p>An advantage of a large stdlib, which PHP has, is that you can get to a point where you can build something reliable without reinventing the wheel either on your own or by pulling in a bunch of userland packages, which might conflict dep-wise to the point that you're either forced to use (and maintain) older versions, or have to do like Guzzle did and swap namespaces so you can run the newer, BC-incompatible version alongside the older one.</p><p>Don't get me wrong, I love Composer and haven't written any PHP extensions (once PHP 7 drops I may get into that biz...who knows?). But in the particular case of password_* being able to point to a best practice in core, \"Make sure you have a reasonably recent runtime and then just use this function,\" is a huge step forward security-wise for the language that powers a huge portion of the web, dev'd on by folks who vary experience-wise.</p><p>Another example here is the RFC for a reliable, real CSPRNG in core. Becuase too many people are using random(), shuffle(), mt_rand() and uniqid() improperly. You can pull in randomlib...or you can point people to use a vetted function, with polyfills available for older versions, that is a sound building block.</p><p>On the other side of the issue are things that are amazing when standardized, but are not matters of flat-out security so you can implement them in PHP or as extension (the latter for performance). The PSR-7 web server interface is a solid example of this. No need to put it into core because folks who want it will opt into it, and folks who don't aren't doing something horribly insecure by default (SQLi can happen in PSR-7 too). Same thing for the PSR-3 logging interface (in contrast to PHP's internal error and exception handling system, to which new levels have been added in recent history, which is something you want to be able to rely on).</p><p>By the way, Composer (which is itself in userland and is aggressively updated) seems to me to be a solid replacement for PEAR. Maybe I'm missing something though.</p><p>In sum, while I agree with the last sentence of your post, please pick on some other piece of core. Heck, pick on uniqid(); I think it fits your description of \"why should this be in core\" a lot better than password_hash() and password_verify() unless I'm mistaken.</p>",

First, by splitting the request from the response you introduce a security risk, because now the result of the query can be accessed by everyone knowing the response ID, especially for private data I would not like that. Apart from that the server now has to keep the result available and is going to be bloated with useless data. How long should the results be kept? You can't drop the result after receiving the first GET request, because in that case there is no sense for the GET at all, because any second request made to the same response will fail anyway. So keep it for 90 seconds? What if the user has a very slow internet connection? Keep it for an hour? With 100,000 requests/s you're kind a dead within minutes. So that doesn't scale at all. The next problem is that either you need a database or any kind of storage in the background to keep the data or you need to ensure that the GET request comes to the same host that the original POST got to; so you either need different domains (sub-domains) or a layer 7 load balancing, what you might not need for any other purpose. Another problem is the dramatically increased latency, in fact you double the latency, for a satellite connection this means that you may add up to one second to your response time. And why all that effort? Just to support an idempotent request for something that is, due to its nature, not idempotent. The reason why it is not idempotent is volatility. In fact the resource you query is modifiable and not static, therefore there is no guarantee that the same request will always return the same response (concurrency). So I think what Dropbox did makes sense and I agree to their statement. My 2 cent.</p>",

This includes sanitization, or controllers adding default values, or removing others.</p><p>Also I don't like these withXxx() methods, if you need to change multiple things you create a lot of intermediate instances for nothing. I elected to implement a change() method that allows me to obtain an altered copy of a request with many changed aspects in a single step.</p><p>Contrary to Request instances, ICanBoogie's Response instances are completely mutable.

If it is, then it streams the request in when running $request-&gt;getBody()-&gt;getContent().  This could be given a \"sensible\" default in PSR-7 but is open enough to be able to be changed by people or frameworks that feel it should be a higher or lower threshold.  A user could check if it's streaming using $request-&gt;isStreaming() and then run a loop over the object - if it implemented the Traversable interface of course!  This also means the $request-&gt;getBody()-&gt;getContent() method could check for streaming, loop over it and save it locally, and then return the whole thing to the application.  This way, when using the Request object, the developer doesn't need to worry about all the streaming issues if they don't want to.</p><p>.....oooooooor create a subclass of the Request object called StreamingRequest or something that can be used if a developer knows they are streaming in content.</p>",

            "message": "<p>My own request and response models in the past have always been mutable. Why? Because these are objects, not values, unlike e.g. DateTime which desperately needed an immutable counterpart. Requests and responses? Definitely not values. Objects for sure. In PHP, objects are mutable, the only exception being value objects such as time stamps, because changing the time stamp makes it inherently a new value. Every case I can think, with immutable request and response models, I will have to simply throw away the previous instance after making a change - which makes immutability rather pointless, if in every case, the new object is going to replace the old, the net effect is equivalent to simply changing the object in the first place. So you will be fighting immutability every step of the way, and, as you pointed out, APIs will end up looking rather kinky.</p><p>As for issues with streaming larger volumes of data, I agree completely. A common use case for me is a long running CSV or XML export, which has to stream and cannot be buffered because it won't fit in memory. Even if it fit, buffering is unnecessary and a waste of resources, and requires the end user to wait for the whole data stream to be prepared before they can start downloading the result. That's crazy. My own response models in the past have always simply had a send() method, which would write to the output buffer - a simple approach that doesn't get in the way of testing, as you can simply turn on another output buffer, if needed. Whether it's sending a 100MB binary or a partial response or an HTML document or something else, has never been an issue for me with that model.

Yes, a good developer can get stuff done in any language, but choosing an arbitrary one (the one you use to know) doesn't make a good choice. There are non-non-sensical reasons why PHP (and MySQL!) is blamed the way it is, and this is really not related to n00bs (they are plenty in Java, RoR and Node too, I consider neither very good yet way better than PHP).

For me that combination of languages has been: Python, HTML, SQL, JavaScript (JQuery and ReactJS is enough), CSS (Bootstrap is enough) and just enough Bash and Linux command line tools to get by. With that you can build anything you really want - from a website to a large scale data processing system to embedded software to desktop apps to API services to data analytics dashboards to hardware testing setups to financial transaction auditing software to that script to trigger your smart lightbulb.</p><p>Python has a TON of great libraries and nice bindings to C libraries for things where speed matters more than readability as well as an active community that takes good code quality and zen very seriously. You can write any software in Python and when you sometimes do hit an actual speed issue (and not just bad design that iterates over 100 million entries multiple times needlessly) then you can easily drop down to C for that one critical function.</p><p>The critical part is the feeling that with what you know you can tackle any software problem.

I know for sure that there will be incompatibilities when there are multiple flash players on the market. The same has happended to HTML and CSS. Yeah, i know it's all the fault of Microsoft IE but there is not much we can do about it, because people will still be using IE for a while. When Adobe REALLY opens up Flash (open sources the Flash Player code) then i think there should always be a central party that monitors the implementation of the Flash format.\r\n\r\nWe all want standards like HTML 5, SVG and JavaScript 2 but the problem is that there are like 8 browser vendors who all have to implement those technologies on 3 OS'es. This takes a while (10 years?). For now Flash and/or Silverlight can be good option if you have to provide features that are impossible to implement consistent across multiple OS'es and browsers with the current standards. If the standards are finished and working then i will stop using Flash to create video and RIA applications and start using HTML 5 en JavaScript 2.\r\n\r\n",

You don't want deadlocks or any such, you want things to time out gracefully and handle this case in your code.\r\n\r\nI do like the approach of being able to send object and class data over the line, even though this is also of course a bit questionable: The idea to have seperated entities doing certain functions implies certain abstraction, and in this case it would be the most \"clean\" if these entities don't know anything about eachother except where they are and what they do. Yet, I can imagine the usefulness in some cases I guess :)\r\n\r\nI may just check this out a bit more and play with it. I have one situation that asked for a similar approach.",

Otoh, as long as major apps support the old version, hosters are not encouraged to upgrade. Luckily, for php 4 the final date has been set: the 5th of feb. 2008...\r\n\r\nAnother factor which is very difficult to estimate is the pain caused by incompatibility problems. Php5 took great pains to break as little as possible from php 4, but in fact it broke a lot of very small, corner cases. People running production apps know that things are likely to break on an upgrade, and are usually loath/have little time for testing. As long as the new version looks very similar to the old one, the perceived advantages in migrating might be smaller than what they actually are. Sometimes it is better to just forget about the 'keep it compatible' mantra, since it is never gonna be 100% satisfied, and make bold improvements.\r\n\r\nOne last \"fact\": php5 was unusable up to version 5.1, and a few early adopters got burned by bugs / performance problems.\r\n\r\nOh, and what about sVista?

I never have to actually search for files, I can find the folder + filename using a hash function.\r\n\r\nI used to use md5 on a file id and then use the first 4 characters for the top-level directory, the second 4 chars for the second level.. but 4 hex chars means 2^16 directories..

Why this is, is currently not known.\r\n\r\nYour solution might work for the SWF you're using, but for others it might not.. Its not a matter of specifying opaque or transparent, the real problem is that in some edge-cases it doesn't work a all.\r\n\r\nPlease read my post before you make any assumptions. I'll often post stuff about software that won't exactly work as intended, and usually I'll do the appropriate research and based on my research my recommendation is to try to avoid transparency and opaque altogether to avoid any potential problem. Mainly, because its flaky..\r\n\r\nSo in short, great that this works for you, but this won't work for everyone. Google the subject if you'd like more info. \r\n\r\nI should also note that this post is made 2,5 years ago and since then we got 2 new flash players. I haven't since checked out if this is still an issue so maybe the issues have been resolved since then. But back then, transparency was flaky and was known to not always work.",

Upload page containing SWF uploader is accessible to authorised users\r\n2. A user logs in on HTML page (plain old <Form/>) and gains access to HTML page containing SWF uploader.\r\n3. Files are posted to \"upload.php\" on the server.\r\n4. upload.php should already be aware of the existing user session to place uploaded files into user's home folder and to create correct database records.\r\n\r\nSo the problem is with item #4. A new session is created by upload.php, thus losing authentication info.\r\n\r\nAny ideas on how to solve it?\r\n\r\nBy the way, I experience this problem only with Firefox.

Remoting can hold a session, file uploading will not in firefox, but does in IE because of a bug in IE (not talking the latest version of IE, I don't know about that one).

I do try to stay objectively and keep my opinion out of my posts.\r\n\r\nI simply disliked the fact that his first response was 'I deny all allegations', to be followed with admitting that he didn't know where the code was coming from and that it did in fact looked like a straight copy. \r\n\r\nIf all this was followed with an apology my tone would have been 180 degrees different. I don't think till is a liar, and if I came across that way I'd like to apologize for that. I'll take out the second paragraph out of the article.\r\n\r\n(the paragraph said : \"Whether Till actually did steal the code, or if he was mislead is unclear to me, and I won't make any unverified claims.\"  ; I'd also not want to lose journalistic integrity).\r\n\r\nEvert",

I think it's fantastic that you have donated so much time to helping other programmers.\r\n\r\nHaving a little bit of AMFPHP experience, I was up and running with SabreAMF (and Flex) in 5 minutes after reading Renaun's tutorial (http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/articles/remoteobject_sabreamf.html).\r\n\r\nOne thing I did have to do to get it working with my particular setup was to alter my includes path so that all the SabreAMF require_once's would work. The way I have my setup is to have all my common PHP libs stored in a folder within my PHP includes folder so that I can use them from any project. With this setup, all I need is a custom gateway.php, as well as services and vo folders, for each project and I can use the one installation of SabreAMF for every project. All I had to do to get this working was to include this line at the start of each project's gateway.php:\r\n\r\nset_include_path( get_include_path() . PATH_SEPARATOR . get_include_path() . '/my__common_libs_folder/' );\r\n\r\nI only mention this in case others wish to use a setup like mine. SabreAMF works fine out of the box as long as you put the files in their recommended locations.\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\nDarren.",

            "message": "Another couple of observations about SabreAMF from someone moving across from AMFPHP (which may or may not be helpful to you):\r\n\r\n1. I found that I had to call SabreAMF_ClassMapper::registerClass before instantiating the SabreAMF_CallbackServer to get the mapping from Flex to PHP to work. I sort of anticipated that registerClass may need to be called before the onInvokeService listener was set but I was surprised that it had to be called even before the SabreAMF_CallbackServer was instantiated. So, using Renaun's code (DataServicesServer.php), this was the only order that worked for me:\r\n\r\npublic function __construct() {\r\n   SabreAMF_ClassMapper::registerClass('com.renaun.samples.vo.UserVO','UserVO');\r\n   $this->server = new SabreAMF_CallbackServer();\r\n   $this->server->onInvokeService = array($this,'invokeService');\t\r\n}\r\n\r\nThis order of instructions wasn't clear to me from the docs and it also didn't occur to me straight away because if I set a listener for $onGetRemoteClass instead, this seems to work fine after the SabreAMF_CallbackServer is instantiated (which is where Renaun has it). Maybe it would be worthwhile mentioning in the wiki that 'SabreAMF_ClassMapper::registerClass' should be called before 'new SabreAMF_CallbackServer();' for Flex to PHP mapping to work. Or maybe this is obvious and I'm just a little slow.\r\n\r\n2. Similarly, adding a listener using SabreAMF_ClassMapper::$onGetLocalClass only works if it is placed before \"new SabreAMF_CallbackServer();' while SabreAMF_ClassMapper::$onGetRemoteClass works both before or after. By the way, I wrote this tiny getLocalClass function which seems to work well for Flex:\r\n\r\npublic function getLocalClass( $dataClassName ) {\r\n   $className = array_pop(explode(\".\", $dataClassName));\r\n   if(class_exists($className)) {\r\n      return $className;\r\n   } else {\r\n      return SabreAMF_ClassMapper::getRemoteClass( $dataClassName );\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n\r\n3. Is there a typo in line 118 of ClassMapper.php? Should it be:\r\n\r\nthrow new Exception('Classname received from onGetRemoteClass should be a string or return false. ' . gettype($remoteClass) . ' was returned');\r\n\r\nI hope some of this is helpful.\r\n\r\nI'm really liking SabreAMF. I hope to use it on most of my future Flex-PHP projects. If you do get AMFEXT working with your framework project, I hope you will consider making SabreAMF AMFEXT-compatible because at the moment the faster speed seems to be the only reason I would consider using AMFPHP on some bigger projects.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nDarren.\r\n",

There are a lot  of \"its gotta be your fault' comments in the string, but I have found numerous incidents of this occurring.  Some folks seem to think it is related to the lid warping causing the screen to twist when closing.Does anyone have any experience with this where Apple fessed up and actually repaired rather than calling their customers liars?

I freaked out for a few days, but then did some research and found  Mission Repairs (http://www.missionrepair.com/).  \r\n\r\nThis repair center specializes in damaged Apple products.  You simply mail them your computer and they'll send it back within a day or two of when they received it.  My repair cost $200 (plus $60 dollar insured shipping from VA), compared to $900.  My computer came back perfectly with a brand new screen!  I highly recommend Mission Repairs: they were prompt, had great customer service and easy instructions, and saved me a lot of money!",

Then again, making use of transactions too much (especially with MySQL) can also kill your performance.

Making two calls. If the insert was successful, why not just show them the values that were inserted, instead of bothering the back-end with another call?\r\n\r\n2. Assuming that replication is instant. Obviously not a safe assumption in high-traffic systems, or slower replication systems like Amazon SimpleDB.\r\n\r\nRather than complicate your code with selecting conditional reads (some from master, some from slave), I suggest you re-examine your whole system for tolerance of inconsistency.\r\n\r\nFor more on this topic, check out Werner Vogel's excellent post: http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2007/12/eventually_consistent.html",

Each business object doesnt know to what specific database it's connecting, you pass it a DB handle (a DB adapter in this case) and it's using that one when it needs database access. This way, your business object is independant from the actual location of your DB, you might choose one location in one script, and another in another script. Since a business object can use a business object which in turn can use another, it's a bit problematic with this master/slave situation, and I'm still evaluating if our framework needs to be changed or if a subclassed DB adapter would be the way to go.",

On the other hand, Zend_Amf is a relatively low-level component that Wade Arnold has already announced will form the base upon which AMFPHP will be written, allowing him to add extra functionality to Zend_Amf (which he also wrote) that wouldn't necessarily fit into the design goals of ZF. You could also build on top of Zend_Amf if you're concerned about re-inventing that wheel. Of course, you're always welcome to help us out in developing more features in Zend_Amf itself. :) ",

Another thing, if you register a destructor before forking, it will be called twice - by the child and the parent so you can get very weird results sometimes.\r\n\r\nBest practice (from my own experience) is to fork your process and THEN do the processing once it has forked.\r\n\r\nFinally; don't forget to: declare(ticks=1); and register a signal handler; otherwise your only way of killing the script will be a \"kill -9 PID\" with no chance of graceful exiting.

I do get zombies if I don't properly do pcntl_wait(), but I have no problem just killing them when the parent process is also gone.

You can see some of the tracks I've collected with the Trackstick at http://apps.kevinhoyt.org/kevin/woik/.\r\n\r\nI've been eyeing an upgrade to the AMOD unit for Christmas myself.  Mac compatible, shows up as a drive, gives you access to the data without additional drivers, and includes a strap and carabiner.  It sounds like their initial release was flawed, but that they've fixed those problems since.  I'm pretty sure this'll be where I land.  If you make the plunge, let me know what you think!\r\n\r\nAnother contender, though not USB, that I was considering for a while was the iBlue 747.  It's connects via Bluetooth, which I thought was novel.  It also has a more modern GPS chipset (MTK v SiRF).  It doesn't however have any fastening mechanism, and as commented earlier, line of sight is important for highest accuracy.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to notes on your pick and why!\r\n\r\nKevin",

Main complaint is that once (and only once in the last year) it lost a couple of days worth of data...\r\n\r\nComes with (Windows) drivers and custom software to get the data off...

Furthermore, as this post seems to cover more than just standards, there are some other niceties to consider ;-).\r\nFirst, for storing geographical data and querying it PostGIS (http://postgis.refractions.net) is the way to go. It is fast, has a lot of features and is under active development. Second, if you want a standardized interface towards your geo data, MapServer (http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu) is easy to setup, easy to use and can act as a Web Map Service, Web Feature Service and/or Web Coverage Service server (all services are OGC standards).For viewing, there are some free (and open) mapping viewers which can interface with WMS, WFS and sometimes WCS. These are OpenLayers (http://openlayers.org) for javascript and FlamingoMC (http://www.flamingo-mc.org) for Flash. Finally there are tons of geo data freely available on the web which you can combine with your own gathered data. OpenStreetMap (http://openstreetmap.org) creates a full database of street data and the United States National Atlas also provides a free wide (albeit a bit outdated) set of databases at http://www-atlas.usgs.gov/maplayers.html. There's really a lot of cool (and very useful) stuff out there, and tons of possibilities for new mapping applications :-).\r\n\r\n",

And adding new tests to your suites is very verbose, with lots of boiler plate code.\r\n\r\nIt is helpful that the command line runner now supports targeting a directory of tests so you don't have to manually build out huge suite scripts. However, if you use this technique you have to give up suite-level organization altogether, and suite-level setUp and tearDown.\r\n\r\nI've been really excited about getting into testing, mainly because of this guy: http://misko.hevery.com/ But PHPUnit's suite API has been a thorn in my side.\r\n\r\nOut of frustration I implementing a suite builder that automatically adds tests that are in the same directory as the suite, and recursively in any sub-directories. If it hits a child suite, it just adds it and stops searching sub-directories.\r\n\r\nYou use the builder to implement the suite() factory method of each suite class. Just 2 lines of code. All the configuration comes from the location of the suite source file in your test directory:\r\n\r\n$builder = new TestSuiteBuilder();\r\nreturn $builder->build(__CLASS__,dirname(__FILE__));\r\n",

It would be trivial to tie such a grid to a search input and bind this to a keystroke -- thus allowing the user to narrow and refine their results, as well as scroll through all of them.\r\n\r\nPagination serves two fundamental issues: keeping page sizes smaller (which will result in both a faster page load as well as smaller browser memory footprint), and allowing additional page impressions for purposes of ad impressions.

If your data can be displayed without a pager without killing the user's browser it is a good idea - given you also have the processing power to do so.\r\n\r\nPages do not only exist to split up large amounts of data, sometimes they are simply a performance tradeoff on the server side. Especially in the case of dynamic data, even if you use aggressive caching, a lot of pageviews will kill a lot of server availability that you may need for other things.\r\n\r\nIdeally I would love a grid display like most media players (or email clients for that matter) offer today, where you have all your songs/emails in one big list. A search field that dynamically reduces the list by keywords is even better than Option+F imo. That way you don't have to skip from one item to the next, the list is reduced to what is relevant.\r\n\r\nFor example, the Mozilla Thunderbird mail client has such a search field, where typing \"php\" will reduce the list to only those emails whose subject contains that keyword. You can also specify which part of the email to apply the search to.\r\n\r\nOf course that means javascript/AJAX again, but from a user point of view it's definitely worth looking into.",

We do indeed use mod_php, because my experiences with PHP through FastCGI has been less than smooth.\r\n\r\nGuest,\r\n\r\nThat's actually a bit scary! Maybe I'm completely missing the point, but I think there's a much much higher chance of acceptance to the PHP source if this stuff was done using many smaller fixes/patches vs. one big patch! ",

The thing that bothers me with this setup, is that the need for 2 webserver products to achieve a single task. This implies that neither of them is adequate on it's own to do the job.\"\r\n\r\nI think the main logic really is that nginx is just faster, especially in a situtation where applications are capable of caching themselves. At that point Squid becomes just another user of RAM that adds less of a benefit than using it in front of a non-caching application. And there is, without doubt, a scaling element. Squid is fantastic when scaling, but nginx can easily beat it at a smaller scale.\r\n\r\nIt's a contest over resources, not functionality. Apache + Squid are heavyweights, Nginx + Application Caching are lightweights. Depending on your resources the winning strategy can go either way or simply tie.\r\n\r\nSomeday though, someone will actually benchmark the two! At the moment it's largely a matter of opinion as to which works best in any one scenario.\r\n\r\nI definitely need to try out php-fpm!!! :)",

It is mostly used for content negotiation, linking from a generic resource to a specific resource: http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Generic.html (and therefore not re-usable if you already do content negotiation since it will contain different URIs depending on the request).\r\nBut that's not really what you want to achieve here, rather you'd want to link in the other direction so that you generic resource appears in the search results.\r\nI think however that they could've just used base URIs. Using them for that purpose doesn't seem to contradict their semantics in my opinion. And they're just as easy to implement in HTML: http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/links.html#h-12.4\r\nThey only downside I can see with that is that the base URI has to be absolute - rel=\"canonical\" allows the user to use relative URIs.\r\nContent-Location sets the base URI as well, btw. Although I think that this has quite the opposite effect to merging URLs, especially if you use content negotiation.",

I then tried to maintain a table that contains only the entries where I have the coordinates but this did not integrate well with the rest of my application.\r\n\r\nAlso note that all the spatial functions on MySQL work with Euclidean (planar) geometry - so the shape of earth is not taken into account. \r\n\r\nI once tried Postgresql with PostGis support which works perfectly fine and is easy to use, but of course it is not so easy to switch to a different database system just like that. Also lots of postgres hosting companies do not offer the postgis extension.\r\n\r\nGood luck\r\n\r\nClaudia",

My tests (in combination with Openoffice) showed me that it is even performant - the bottle neck always was Openoffice not server side. \r\n\r\nI would like to make a plugin for cakephp out of it. Maybe you heart about cake. The idea is having a plugin as a wrapper for Sabre and your library itself as a vendor file. \r\n\r\nSince cakephp is a MVC framework the biggest task while writing a plugin would be to bring the pieces to where they belong:\r\nLike the file system should go to model, as well as locking. The \"hand over\" of the files or errror messages should be delivered by the view. And finally the rest goes to controller. \r\n\r\nDo you think it is possible to write a wrapper plugin like that?",

I haven't actually tried to make 2 packages that send files to conflicting places to test this, but I'd hope that since PEAR *could* know which packages own which files, that it would prevent such a collision. It'd be a good thing to test, for sure. In any case, the canonical pearfarm install has each project's files in its own directory, so this shouldn't ever be a problem.\r\n\r\nThat said, the fact that it's hard to create & share a PEAR package is *not* a good thing, it makes it hard to share code, and without code sharing & easy peer review, the community progresses very slowly.\r\n\r\n@greg - our lead server dev Scott Davis built a RESTful PEAR server from scratch. We got a lot of extra flexibility by doing this, so that we can start to do ratings and other things to help with package selection.\r\n\r\nWe didn't use pyrus as our basis since we wanted to avoid the 5.3 requirement. It would be great to have a pyrus plugin for pearfarm. The project is open-source, feel free to join the project and help us do that! The packaging code is factored out nicely, it shouldn't be terribly hard to do.\r\n\r\nI'll also point out that pearfarm does use PKI and sign all packages. This is how we make it so easy to push packages to pearfarm from the command line. I suppose that we could expose the signatures on the website so that you could verify them on the download side. I'll have to think about the security considerations of that.\r\n\r\nWe just heard about pearhub.org today when we read this blog post. A few difference between our systems:\r\n\r\n1. Pearfarm includes a spec for *building* packages. We don't just tarball your entire git repo. This also means that you can have your pearfarm packages include \"executables\". I don't see how you'd do that with pearhub.\r\n\r\n2. Each pearfarm user gets his own channel, vs one giant shared channel. This was done for performance reasons and to eliminate the \"who owns this package\" problem. Also the pearfarm model allows multiple forks of a single project to all be hosted easily and conceptually in a similar way to how GitHub works.\r\n\r\nThanks again for the post! \r\n\r\nAlan",

            "message": "The case between divs and tables is indeed a very \"beath to death\" argument.  However, its something that (as the author has said) is very much misunderstood.\r\n\r\nThe example (as many have pointed out) does appear to be the \"rounded corners hack\" to make it work.  To me though, this is the work of someone who doesn't understand how to use images to achieve this exact same concept without the need of a hundred divs.\r\n\r\nTables, in retrospect, is not going to help (or hurt) designing rounded corners in this method.  It's going to be just as difficult.  What it boils down to though, is not if tables or divs are the best solution for rounded corners, but if the designer who built this HTML is the best suited.\r\n\r\nJust to clarify on the \"old argument/debate\" between Tables and Div's, there are a few reasons to use tables, and a few reasons not to.\r\n\r\nReasons to use tables include:\r\n* Displaying report-style data in a clean, row/column layout.\r\n\r\n* Displaying form data\r\n\r\n* Creating a foundation for page layout when situations of keeping a bottom/top position on the page is necssary and can only be achieved through mass amounts of div's and css.\r\n\r\nReasons NOT to use tables include:\r\n* Formatting and designing entire page and internal content for page layout.\r\n\r\n* Speed (as a page will not load until all tables are loaded first).\r\n\r\n* Positioning elements on your page\r\n\r\n* Creating any sort of content layout.\r\n\r\nNow, some will argue on this point as there are many good points on both sides of the coin.  I personally am about utilizing both tables and divs to get the job done, but only using one or the other based on what they were meant to be used for... not because \"I\" think that one is better than the other.",
